 * Programs ask a user to input their name, individually first and last part,
 * and outputs a name into two different form: 1) straight, 2) inverse with comma

 * In the end, try to input both first and last names in the same line. Why a
 * program considers two words separated with spaces as two independend inputs?
 * How to fix it? â†’ see 2nd example.
